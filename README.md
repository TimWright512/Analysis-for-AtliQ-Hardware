Product Analysis for AtliQ Hardware
You're working as a junior analyst for the TTWC consulting agency ("TripleTen World Consultancy"). This year, you're dealing with a particularly special client: AtliQ Hardware.
AtliQ Hardware is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India, and has even expanded into other countries as well. They sell different types of hardware to big players such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart.
This year, they're asking PWC to conduct a big audit of their sales and help them automate their existing data.
The clients are particularly interested in the following business area:
Product Analysis Which items are the bestsellers? How can the company improve its sales? How has popularity changed over time/across markets?â€¦
They have asked your team to look into this area, conduct the necessary research, and create dashboards that the company will be able to use later. 

Which items are best sellers?: The analysis successfully identified the best-selling products and their respective variants. This was achieved by grouping products and variants together based on the quantity sold, sorting them from most sold to least sold. Furthermore, the data was broken down by each fiscal year to observe year-over-year trends for specific products and their variants, providing insights into their sales performance over time.

How can the company improve its sales?: The analysis successfully pinpointed the markets with the highest quantity of products sold and the highest gross profit. This was accomplished by grouping markets together and visually representing the sold quantity and gross profit data through graphs to identify the top-performing markets. Additionally, the data was broken down by region, allowing for a comparison to determine which of the four regions needed the most attention and where efforts should be focused to enhance sales performance.

How has popularity changed over time across markets?: The analysis involved grouping data by date and markets based on their sold quantity to track how the quantity of products sold in each market changed over time. To make this trend more visually apparent, a line graph was used to illustrate the growth or decline in the quantity of products sold in each market over time.
