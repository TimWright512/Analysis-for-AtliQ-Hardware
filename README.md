Product Analysis for AtliQ Hardware
You're working as a junior analyst for the TTWC consulting agency ("TripleTen World Consultancy"). This year, you're dealing with a particularly special client: AtliQ Hardware.
AtliQ Hardware is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India, and has even expanded into other countries as well. They sell different types of hardware to big players such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart.
This year, they're asking PWC to conduct a big audit of their sales and help them automate their existing data.
The clients are particularly interested in three business areas:
Financial Analysis: Revenue/Profits/Margin Change Research How have revenue/profits changed over time? How has the market shifted? What categories are most profitable?…
Product Analysis Which items are the bestsellers? How can the company improve its sales? How has popularity changed over time/across markets?…
Customer Analysis Segmentation of customers: who are they and what do they buy? How can we improve business with them?…
They have asked your team to look into these areas, conduct the necessary research, and create dashboards that the company will be able to use later. 
Out of the 3 given research areas, choose the one that interests you the most and create a detailed research plan. Feel free to discuss all options with your team leader and peers during the call or over chat.
